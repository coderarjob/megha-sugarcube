MEGHA OPERATING SYSTEM SUGARCUBE                                  INTRODUCTION
--------------------------------                                  ------------

This version of Megha Operating System is more for the proof of concept. Many
modules like the VFS exist for the namesake, and many more features like
'mountable file systems' etc, simply do not exist.

The motivation of this version is that I want a usable operating system before
10th Feb 2020, and it is already 21st October 2019. I want to have a demo ready
for Jayati before our marriage day.

Wish me Luck!
