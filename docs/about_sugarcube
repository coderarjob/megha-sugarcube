MEGHA OPERATION SYSTEM SUGARCUBE 
- ABOUT AND DESIGN GOALS
- Dated: 21 Oct 2019

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Sugarcube is a simple Operating System that only deals with the very basics
of features. Think of it as the first version of DOS. Based on x86 processor,
it is capable of becoming a very complex Operating System, but at this stage, I
want to keep it very simple and build on the knowledge gained in my later
software projects.

Design Goals:
---------------------------

1. Only thoes features should exist that we cannot do without.
2. FAT12 file system that is capable of 
   - Creating new files 
   - Reading (some bytes from random locations) from existing files.
   - User can keep multiple files open and read, write system calls must work
	 with one provided by the user.
3. A basic command interpretter
   - Opening a program into memory.
   - Parameters to programs
   - Redirection operatiors
4. Terminal 
   - Can handle CR, LF, backspace and some other special characters.
   - Color text support on VGA displays.
   - Ability to move cursor around screen.
5. Keyboard and 8254 PIT drivers
6. Basic Sound
