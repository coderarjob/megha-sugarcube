MEGHA OPERATING SYSTEM SUGARCUBE                                  INTRODUCTION
--------------------------------                                  ------------

The Sugarcube is a simple Operating System that only deals with the very basics
of features. Think of it as the first version of DOS. Based on x86 processor,
it is capable of becoming a very complex Operating System, but at this stage, I
want to keep it very simple and build on the knowledge gained in my later
software projects.

Design Goals:
---------------------------

1. Only thoes features should exist that we cannot do without.
2. FAT12 file system that is capable of 
   - Creating new files 
   - Reading (some bytes from random locations) from existing files.
   - User can keep multiple files open and read, write system calls must work
	 with one provided by the user.
3. A basic command interpretter
   - Opening a program into memory.
   - Parameters to programs
   - Redirection operatiors
4. Terminal 
   - Can handle CR, LF, backspace and some other special characters.
   - Color text support on VGA displays.
   - Ability to move cursor around screen.
5. Keyboard and 8254 PIT drivers
6. Basic Sound

This version of Megha Operating System is more for the proof of concept. Many
modules like the VFS exist for the namesake, and many more features like
'mountable file systems' etc, simply do not exist.

The motivation of this version is that I want a usable operating system before
10th Feb 2020, and it is already 21st October 2019. I want to have a demo ready
for Jayati before our marriage day.

Wish me Luck!

Features available in Sugarcube:
--------------------------------

1. Console module, for displaying text on the screen.
2. FAT12 file system with the system calls for opening, reading and writing.
3. An command interpreter.
4. A functional keyboard driver with type ahead features and code pages.
5. A simple sound driver, capable of pitch change and producing sound.
6. A 8251 PIT driver.
7. Few simple programs:- cat, dir, echo.
8. Modules:- Guru, Despatcher, Console, Sound, KDB, MKRNL
9. Many modules like the Console, terminal, VFS, even tough available in
   Sugarcube, are not the final versions and will lac many features.

---------------------------------

1. Will have one mount point for the floppy using the FAT12 file system.
2. VFS mount, and umount is not available, but vfs_open, vfs_read, vfs_write,
   vfs_close system calls will work as expected as if there was only one drive.
3. A program called JAYATI for our special night.


Features not available in Sugarcube:
------------------------------------

1. DEVFS, so devices can be treated as files.
2. VFS, ability of open, read and write files seemlessly between different
   devices and different file systems.
3. Ability to mount devices.
4. Extensibe driver model:- Ability to have hook methods etc.
