CYLINDER SECTOR HEAD ADDRESSING
-------------------------------

Logical sectors are numbers that start from 0 and are used to address uniform
blocks (usually made up of fixed 512 bytes). Using these logical sectiors, we
can address whole of the disk and every block that makes up the disk.

Howerver, this logical blocks cannot be used in bios system calls - we convert 
these logical block numbers to another form of address, that uses cylinder,
sector and head for addressing.

Following will discuss the procedure to convert logical addressing to CSH
addressing.

Information:
------------
A disk have platers (each with two or one head) each having tracks and each of
the tracks have some sectors in it. 
These sectors (just blocks of bytes) are addressed using numbers starting 
from 1.  Every track have the same number of sectors. On a floppy 
1440Kb floppy, there are 18 sectors per track, and each of the sector is a 
block of 512 bytes. 

An importaint thing to note that in 1440Kb floppy with two heads, the odd and
even tracks are places alternatively on both sides, and one head read all the
even and another reads all the even tracks. This is done to minimise the head
movement.

For example:

Track 0 is read by the head 0, and track 1 using head 1, track 2 using track 0
and so on.

PROCEDURE CSH:
		  INPUT:	Logical address A
		  OUTPUT: 	SECTOR	 S
					CYLINDER C
					Head	 H

	; calculate the track number
		Q = A / SECTORS_PER_TRACK
		C = Q / HEAD_COUNT

	; calculate the sector number
		S = A % SECTORS_PER_TRACK
		S = S + 1					; Sector number starts from 1

	; calculate head
		H = Q % HEAD_COUNT

END PROCEDURE

At the end of this procedure, we can ask Head H to go to cylinder C and read
sector S on that cylinder. The concept of cylinder and head makes the use of
platter number while addressing redundent.

SECTIORS PER TRACK
------------------
First comes the geometry of the disk. In case of the 1440KB floppy, following
describes the geometry.

	* Number of sides per plater      : 2
	* Number of platter               : 1
	* Total number of heads           : 2 (2 heads * 1 platter)
	* Tracks per side of each platter : 80
	* Total bytes                     : 1440 KB

Now we calculate the following with the information given,

	* Bytes per sector                : 512
	* Total number of sectors         : 1440 KB / 512 = 2880 sectors
	* Total number of Tracks          : 80 tracks / side * 2 side * 1 platter 
	                                    = 160 tracks

	* Sectors per track               : 2880 sectors / 160 tracks 
	                                    = 18 sectors/track
