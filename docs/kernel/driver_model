MEGHA OPERATING SYSTEM SUGARCUBE 
- DRIVER MODEL
- Dated: 21 Oct 2019

----------------------------------------------

A driver in MOS Sugarcube is a normal module that can be loaded by the OS
loader or at a later time when interpreter is loading.

The Sugarcube is a very simple operating system and so many of the below
features will not be available.

A driver will communicate with the rest of the system using software defined
interrupts that can be called using the depatcher. Many of the drivers will
have well defined interrupts, even tough nothing is set in stone - If any
driver wants to register its routines with a different IVT then OS will not
stop it. However such drivers will need special programs that will know the
interrupt numbers and can interract with it.

Take for example the Keyboard driver:
 - 3 interrupts will be defined, one for reading and writting, and another for
   configuring the keyboard.
 - Any application/module that wished to read from the keyboard will use one of
   the 3 intterupts.

In keeping with the design goals of the MOS Sugarcube, there will be no
advanced features that we take for granted these days with Linux and Windows.
Drivers will be a integral part of the Operating System - however one driver
can be swapped for another if necessory.

Drivers that will be part of the Operating System:
Keyboard, 8254, Terminal

The Terminal driver is a psudo driver that will
 - Read from the keyboard (using the keyboard driver software interrupt
   routines)
 - Write to the VGA text memory.
 - Configure the Cursor position and cursor layout.
